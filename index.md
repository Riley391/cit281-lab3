# Lab 3
This lab was an exciting one. At the time I was working a lot with Python in my free time, and having to constantly switch between print() and console.log() was not my favourite coding experience. However, learning about require statements (as well as rest/spread operators) meant I could require a function called print which simply calls console.log. Using the rest/spread operators meant it had all the functionality one might expect from console.log and it made my life measurably easier
